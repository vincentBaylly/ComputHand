Having more than 10 years in IT computing especially in web domain, my last experience provides me the skill to give more than just development expertise. I am today able to lead interviews, provide technical and architectural advices, manage a team and add technical analysis in my deliveries. These past exp√©riences allow me to open my own business today. I am looking for IT contracts to offer my skills more efficiently.
